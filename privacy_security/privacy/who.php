<h1>Privacy: who you show information to</h1>

<p class='standfirst'>Do you want to limit which people can see what you think and do?</p>

<p>If so, who do you feel comfortable seeing your posts? Friends and family? Friends of your friends too? Anyone anywhere in the world?</p>
<p>Perhaps you think of 'friends' online as different to friends offline. Maybe you share more with them, maybe less.</p>

<p>Perhaps you show different things to different people depending on the content. You have control over what you put out there.</p>
