<p class='standfirst'>Other people’s content isn’t yours to use without their permission, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Anyone can link to a BBC Weather Watchers photo without permission, by using the <abbr title='Uniform Resource Locator'>URL</abbr>, but the photo itself shouldn’t be copied for another use without their permission.</p>
