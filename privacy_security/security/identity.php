<h1>Identity: who you are</h1>

<p class='standfirst'>Different websites will ask for different combinations of identifying information when you create an account identity. This might include email address, username or nickname, real name, postal address, postcode, or mobile number.</p>

<p>For example, the BBC Weather Watchers site asks you to choose a nickname to display alongside your weather photo, rather than using your real name.</p>

<p>Your identity is unique within each website. You can't usually have two accounts on the same site, if they are tied to the same email address. But you might use the same identifying information on different websites.</p>

<h3>What can go wrong?</h3>

<p>Somebody could pretend to be you and make an account in your name. This is very rare, tending only to happen to people in the public eye.</p>

<p>People can make mistakes typing or remembering their email address. If theirs happens to be similar to yours, they could unintentionally create an account tied to your address. As a result, you might get automatic emails from services you didn't sign up to. You can safely ignore these &ndash; it's as if you received a call from a wrong number.</p>
