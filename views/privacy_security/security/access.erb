<h1>Access security</h1>

<p class='standfirst'>A website will often verify that you are who you say, before allowing you access to your account.</p>

<p>You can think of this as the website providing the window lock, with you as the user bringing the key. If your key doesn't fit, you won't be able to enter.</p>

<p>The most familiar method of authentication for websites is a password. Phones often have passcodes. Some devices now even use biometric identification, like thumb-print unlocking on iPads.</p>

<p>Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of checking. The person logging in needs to know the password and have access to a second device which is used to verify the password. Often it's a text message sent to a phone, or it can be a dedicated device like a bank secure key.</p>

<p>Your access to a website is normally unique to your identity: you can't usually have two accounts on the same site if they’re tied to the same email address. But you can often use the same identifying information, such as your name or nickname, or postal address.</p>


<h3>What can go wrong?</h3>

<p>Somebody could get hold of your password and access your identity. This is why you should use a different password on every account, and never write passwords down.</p>

<p>A password manager like <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> or <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> is really helpful here. You can use these tools to generate strong, random passwords which they then save securely using encryption. You only have to remember one master password for your password manager account. Once you’ve logged into it, you can retrieve and use all the others.</p>
