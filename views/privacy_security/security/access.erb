<h1>Access security</h1>

<p class='standfirst'>A website will often verify that you are who you say, before allowing you access to your account.</p>

<p>You can think of this as the website providing the window lock, with you as the user bringing the key. If your key doesn't fit, you won't be able to enter.</p>

<p>The most familiar method of authentication for websites is a password. Phones often have passcodes. Some devices now even use biometric identification, like thumb-print unlocking on iPads.</p>

<p>Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of checking. The person logging in needs to know the password and have access to a second device which is used to verify the password. That verification could happen by text message, by a smartphone app, or it could be performed on a dedicated device like a bank secure key.</p>

<h3>What can go wrong?</h3>

<p>Somebody could get hold of your password and access your identity. This is why you should use a different password on every account, and never write passwords down.</p>

<p>A password manager like <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> or <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> is really helpful here. You can use these tools to generate strong, random passwords which they then save securely using encryption. You only have to remember one master password for your password manager account. Once youâ€™ve logged into it, you can retrieve and use all the others.</p>
