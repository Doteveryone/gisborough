<h1>Privacy: who you show information to</h1>

<p class='standfirst'>Do you want to limit which people can see what you think and do?</p>

<p>If so, who do you feel comfortable seeing your posts?</p>

<p>For example, on Facebook you can allow or limit who sees your posts so only your friends, friends of friends, or anyone can see. Other apps and sites have similar settings.</p>

<p>Perhaps you think of 'friends' online as different to friends offline. Maybe you share more with them, maybe less.</p>

<p>Perhaps you show different things to different people depending on the content. You have control over what you put out there.</p>

<p>Check your social media settings on six major platforms with <a href="https://identity.utexas.edu/everyone/how-to-manage-your-social-media-privacy-settings" target="_blank">this clear guide from the Center for Identity at the University of Texas.</a></p>
