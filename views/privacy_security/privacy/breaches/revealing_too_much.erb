<h1>Privacy breaches: revealing more than intended</h1>

<p class='standfirst'>A common mistake is being unaware of things being publicly visible. This is usually because a user hasn’t switched the settings on a site or app to match what they want, giving more people authorisation to view things.</p>

<p>Find out how to <a href="https://identity.utexas.edu/everyone/how-to-manage-your-social-media-privacy-settings" target="_blank">check your settings on social media.</a></p>

<p>A common oversight is having one account identity inadvertently connect to another. For example, someone might use their real name and nickname on one site, but just a nickname on another. Googling could help someone link both accounts back to the real name.</p>

<p>Something commonly forgotten is what you share about other people. For example, if they’re in photos with you, or you mention them in a post. Your choices can affect, and maybe breach, other people’s privacy &ndash; just as theirs can yours. If you’re in doubt, ask before you post.</p>
