<p class='standfirst'>In the news, privacy breaches are often associated with deliberate attacks.</p>

  It might be that someone <a href="/privacy_security/privacy/breaches/revealing_too_much">revealed more than they intended.</a><br/>
  It might be that someone has <a href="/privacy_security/privacy/breaches/permissions">taken something without permission.</a><br/>
  It might just be that the <a href="/privacy_security/privacy/breaches/software">software doesn't work correctly.</a><br/>
