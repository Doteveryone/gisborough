<h2>Uploading a photo: what data is sent?</h2>
<p class='standfirst'>You send the data you can see directly on the upload page, and some data you canâ€™t.</p>

<p>Your BBC Weather Watchers upload also sends your login identity, so your photo can be linked to your profile.</p>

<p>On other sites, this extra data might be the date and time you make a post, or the clicks you took to arrive on a page.</p>
