<p class='standfirst'>At Doteveryone, part of making the internet for everyone is making it understandable by everyone.</p>

<p class=''>Weâ€™re starting to create some straightforward explanations about how the internet works, and collecting them here.</p>

<p class=''>We hope being better-informed will help you feel more comfortable online and in the digital world. You might even find the topics interesting!</p>

<p class=''>If you want to know more about a topic we've not covered, let us know by emailing <a href="mailto:explainers@doteveryone.org.uk">explainers@doteveryone.org.uk</a>.</p>
