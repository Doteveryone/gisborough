<h1>What about that green padlock symbol?</h1>

You might have noticed the green padlock symbol in your browser bar.

This symbol means that all of the computers that are part of the network leading to an end website, are sending data securely.

This symbol means that your data will be sent securely between your device and its destination. No computer that your data passes through en route will be able to see what you're sending - it's private between you and the endpoint

It doesn’t mean that what you do on the website stays private, or that the end website stores your data securely.

All e-commerce websites have the green padlock because they ask buyers to send them credit card details. Never pay for anything on a website that doesn’t have a green padlock.
