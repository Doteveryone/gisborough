<h1>What can go wrong?</h1>

<p class='standfirst'>Sometimes, there can be problems with security:</p>

<p><b>Identity:</b> Somebody might pretend to be you and make an account in your name. This is very rare, tending only to happen to people in the public eye.</p>

<p><b>Authentication:</b> Somebody could get hold of your password and access your identity. This is why you should use a different password on every account, and never write passwords down. A password manager like <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> or <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> is really helpful here.</p>

<p><b>Authorisation:</b> Very occasionally you might be able to do things on a site that you should be blocked from. This could be because there are mistakes or bugs in the software that its engineers need to fix. It might be that someone administrating the software gave you too many permissions. Or it could just be a friend may have chosen to share social media post with too wide a group.</p>

  <h2>What that green padlock symbol has to do with security.</h2>
  <div class='inner'>
    <p>You might have noticed the green padlock symbol in your browser bar. It means that all of the computers in the network leading to an end website, are sending data securely.</p>

    <p>This symbol means that your data will be sent securely between your device and its destination. No computer that your data passes through en route can access what you're sending &ndash; it's private on the journey between you and the endpoint.</p>

    <p>It doesn’t mean that what you do on the website stays private, or that the end website stores your data securely.</p>

    <p>All e-commerce websites should have the green padlock because they ask buyers to send them credit card details. Never pay for anything on a website that doesn’t have a green padlock.</p>
