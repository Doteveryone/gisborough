<h1>When you show it</h1>

Life changes over time, so time can also change your choices about your online privacy.

Say you have children, take on a high-profile role, or move to a new town. You might choose to share more or less, or in a different way, depending on your social circle or work environment.

It’s a good idea to reconsider your privacy choices from time to time, and check you’re still comfortable with what you’re showing.
