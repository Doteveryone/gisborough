<h1>How you show it</h1>

You can choose how closely tied your real identity is to your online accounts.

Are you using your real name? Are you completely anonymous? Are you using a pseudonym, like a nickname or handle?

Can people work out who you are from it? Does that matter to you or in your wider life?

Decide what level of identity you're comfortable with, and in which context. You might find it varies.
