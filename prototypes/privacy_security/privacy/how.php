<h1>Privacy: how you show information</h1>

<p class='standfirst'>You can choose how closely tied your real identity is to your online accounts.</p>

<p>Do you want to use your real name? Do you want to be completely anonymous? Do you want to use a pseudonym, like a nickname or handle?</p>

<p>Can people work out who you are from it? Does that matter to you, or in your wider life, if they can?</p>

<p>Consider what sort of identity you're comfortable with, and in which context. You might decide it varies.</p>
