<p class='standfirst'>You can choose how closely tied your real identity is to your online accounts.</p>

<p>Are you using your real name? Are you completely anonymous? Are you using a pseudonym, like a nickname or handle?</p>

<p>Can people work out who you are from it? Does that matter to you or in your wider life?</p>

<p>Decide what level of identity you're comfortable with, and in which context. You might find it varies.</p>
