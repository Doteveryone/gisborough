<h1>Lack of permission</h1>

Other people’s content isn’t yours to use without their permission, and vice versa.

Anyone can link to a Weather Watchers photo without permission, but it shouldn’t be copied for another use without their permission.

Some sites and apps have terms and conditions on the use of members’ content. Copyright law also applies, just as it does to offline creative outputs.

There are exceptions for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> and public domain content. If you’re in doubt, don’t copy.

If it's not a <em>lack of permission</em>:
It might be that someone made a [[mistake|breachMistake]].
It might just be that [[the software doesn't work correctly|breachSoftware]].

(if: (history:) contains "breachMistake" and (history:) contains "breachSoftware")[
<hr/>
That's everything here. You can go [[back to the start|Home]], or find out more about [[Security|security]].
