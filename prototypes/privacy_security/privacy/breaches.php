<h1>Privacy breaches</h1>
People often associate privacy breaches with deliberate attacks.

But privacy is about peopleâ€™s choices, so privacy breaches are often down to human error.

It might be that someone made a [[mistake|breachMistake]].
It might be that someone's been [[given the wrong permissions|breachPermissions]].
It might just be that [[the software doesn't work correctly|breachSoftware]].
