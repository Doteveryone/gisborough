<h1>What you show</h1>

How much are you comfortable with others knowing or seeing of your life: what you think and do, who you spend time with, where you go?

Consider people: friends, family, acquaintances, teammates; colleagues, bosses, employees.
– Does what you share depend on, what you do, when you do it, or who you’re with?
– Are there things you don’t want to show or say of your free time, work time, family time?

Consider events: weddings, birthdays and holidays; nights out and sports matches; conferences and leaving parties.
– Does what you keep private online match what you keep private offline?
– What different things do you do in different contexts that might alter what you share?
– What might people think about you sharing events that involve them?

Consider topics: morals, ethics, religion, politics, personal experiences.
– Would you express the same views online to a wider audience as you would offline to a small group?
– Might you feel more open with a distant audience?
– What implications might expressing your views online have, beyond just making your point?
