<h1>What you show</h1>

<p class='standfirst'>How much are you comfortable with others knowing or seeing of your life: what you think and do, who you spend time with, where you go?</p>

<p>Consider people: friends, family, acquaintances, teammates; colleagues, bosses, employees.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does what you share depend on, what you do, when you do it, or who you’re with?</li>
  <li>Are there things you don’t want to show or say of your free time, work time, family time?</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider events: weddings, birthdays and holidays; nights out and sports matches; conferences and leaving parties.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does what you keep private online match what you keep private offline?</li>
  <li>What different things do you do in different contexts that might alter what you share?</li>
  <li>What might people think about you sharing events that involve them?</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider topics: morals, ethics, religion, politics, personal experiences.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Would you express the same views online to a wider audience as you would offline to a small group?</li>
  <li>Might you feel more open with a distant audience?</li>
  <li>What implications might expressing your views online have, beyond just making your point?</li>
</ul>
