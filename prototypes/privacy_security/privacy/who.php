<h1>Who you show it to</h1>

Do you want to limit which people can see what you think and do?

If so, who do you feel comfortable seeing? Friends and family? Friends of your friends too? Anyone anywhere in the world?

Perhaps who can see changes with what you're showing. You have control over what you put out there.
